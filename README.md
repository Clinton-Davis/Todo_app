## UI

Simple one page layout with the Todo input above the list in the center page with a full page background image.

### Features

- Local storage of list
  The local storage store the list item in an array in string, I used `JSON.stringify` to create an array if item in memory, this way we can treat it like an array.

- Animation
  There is a smiple animation on the list when you click on the trash can to delete the item.
